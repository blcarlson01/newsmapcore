LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said on Sunday he had detected no change in Russian President Vladimir Putin's strategic intentions towards Ukraine, despite a reduction in violence following the Minsk ceasefire agreement. "There has been a reduction in violence since the new agreement was signed but I don't detect that Mr Putin's strategic intentions have changed," he said in an interview on BBC television. "This is just a question now about what tools he uses to achieve those objectives." (Reporting by William James; editing by Jason Neely)
