This method has the potential to eliminate the need for sulphur dioxide and other synthetic materials and preservatives. Journalists were recently invited to sample the new Rooibos drinks at the Audacia wine farm in Stellenbosch. Rooibos, a South African native tea, has been grown in the country for centuries. In the past decade, it has become popular with health-conscious consumers around the globe, leading to growing production and sales. "Roughly half the rooibos crop is exported, the rest is consumed on the African continent of which the vast majority would be in South Africa. South Africa being the biggest rooibos consuming country in the world. If you look further afield Botswana has become a very strong market for rooibos. Zimbabwe also knows the product very well there are several brands in Zimbabwe, then if you look at what some of the supermarket chains are doing in Africa Nigeria for instance, rooibos typical South African brands are finding their way into those markets as well," said Dawie De Villiers, managing director of cape natural tea Products. The new Rooibos wine is the brainchild of wine farm owner Trevor Strydom who started experimenting with the process after drinking a cup of rooibos tea served by his daughter. He and winemaker Michael van Niekerk put rooibos teabags in wine and found that it reduced the need for allergy-inducing sulphur and other common preservatives. They now use the rooibos wood chips in the wine making process instead of the traditional oak. "I see it being drunk all over the world, we registered the patent in 83 jurisdictions worldwide, we are already exporting the wine to China and it definitely will be drunk all over the world," said Strydom. Rooibos and honeybush wood are unique in that they contain no caffeine, low tannin levels making them ideal for use in wine, beer and cider as a natural preservative and flavoring product. "It's going to have definite effects on the global market because the market looks at competitors and especially not having to add sulphur ,there's a huge advantage to the process and that changes the brand, it gives you a new brand that the health conscious world looks at so I'm pretty certain on the back of the rooibos brand that's already around the world you will definitely see traction, but then even as a standalone product because its new its innovative it's got a marketing edge and obviously if they do it cleverly they will get market share quite quickly," said Alan Winde, minister of economic opportunities for the Western Cape government. The Rooibos brand is internationally patented, making it a unique and typical South African product. The plant is grown in the Cedarberg region of Clanwilliam and draws hundreds of tea lovers every year to the district. In the Western Cape roughly 167,000 people are employed in the wine sector", "summary": "In South Africa's scenic wine growing Western Cape, the Audacia winery wants to revolutionize the region's famous industry after patenting a new technique that used Rooibos and Honeybush in the production of wine, beer and ciders." }

Catania found that eels use a pair low intensity pulses to make their victims involuntarily twitch revealing the targets exact location. Then the eel unleashes its high powered electric salvo which leaves its prey literally frozen in a state of shock. To accomplish this Catania found that eels basically take over their victims nervous systems. "So it really is a remote control in a sense of the eels' neurons activating through the electric generating organs the neurons in the prey. And so they are remotely activating their preys' muscles and essentially taking over their peripheral nervous system," he said.

These chips transmitted their location to a nearby computer where researchers could monitor whether or not they were venturing out into the open light or hiding under a shelter. The experiment was then repeated twice more at later dates. Issac Planas, the lead researcher on the project and a PhD student at ULB, said the six-legged creatures made perfect test subjects because of a combination of their decision-making abilities and the extensive research that already exists on roaches. "Cockroaches are a simple animal, but they can reach a complex decision. So with little information, with little interactions, only knowing if I have a partner here or not, only with this information, they can make complex decisions," he said. As Planas explained, the purpose of the experiment was to look at variances in group behavior and the way the group came to a decision. Cockroaches are known for their aversion to light, but also for their affinity for protection and groups. All of these preferences influenced each cockroach's decisions in the arena. As a result, while it might seem probable that they would all quickly gather under the shelters, the study showed that the amount of time it took for the entire group of roaches to settle under a shelter varied. Planas attributed this result to the differences in individual personalities and behavior: if one roach was quick to settle under a shelter then it might encourage others to do the same, reducing the total amount of time needed to achieve the end result. However, Planas also explained that though one cockroach's decision might sway that of another, each cockroach was ultimately responsible for its choice of whether it would remain in the light or rest under the shelter. This distinguishes cockroaches from certain other insects like ants and termites, who act according to a social hierarchy. Planas said that this understanding was important because it meant that the results of the study could be applied to animals with similar behavior patterns. "We have a group of equal individuals that reach a choice, can have consensus decision making as we can see in sheep, bats, some monkey species, fish, birds, for example, or also humans in this case," he told Reuters. What Planas said surprised him the most about the study was that no matter what combination of personalities existed in the group, by the end of the experiment all of the cockroaches ended up beneath the shelters. "The fact, and we didn't expect it, is that they always reach this consensus," Planas explained. "So we expected that some groups have more trouble than others to resist consensus or to choose a shelter, but at the end, no, they always finished aggregated. So it is something really inside the individuals or in the cockroaches. So that was really, that was amazing." The researchers say the varying personalities of the cockroaches could explain their ability to adapt to new surroundings", "summary": "The discovery could explain why cockroaches are considered such great survivors and able to adapt to inhospitable surroundings." }

This is an absolutely unique solution," WB Electronics Director For Research and New Technologies, Wojciech Komorniczak, said. The system is designed to offer support to infantry operating in an urban and densely built-up environment, and has an independent communications system. "This is about a communications system which will operate very well in battle conditions despite dense urban development. Battle conditions are, for instance, when there is no mobile phone connection and the generally available wireless network is gone, so we have to supply such a network by ourselves," Komorniczak said. Other drones in the system are designed to attack targets from the air by flying close to them and exploding. Another solution in the prototype phase is the 'Warmate' drone that is meant to act like a guided missile providing a real-time video feed of its target. "The innovative feature of our solution is that this drone can first identify the target and make sure that it is in fact the enemy our opponent, so that we don't strike innocent people," Komorniczak said. The 'Warmate' drone is planned to be incorporated in the 'Bee' system in the future and is a cheaper and more versatile alternative to commonly used missile systems, the company says. Its full weight is planned to be several kilograms and when stowed away in a special container is meant to be easy to carry. The company tests their drones in various conditions, ranging from Arctic to desert and jungle, as well as in high altitudes.
